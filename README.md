# KernelCI-monitor

This is a simple test job scheduler designed to work together with
[kernelci.org](https://kernelci.org) project. Initial set of data
sets monitoring of 'stable' kernels for BeagleBone Black and Mustang boards.

The tool requires only celery worker to be enabled. Web admin interface may
be used to define additional rules.
